## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/dinhgia2106/Helmet-detect-by-YOLOv10.git
    ```
    
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    Open Helmet_detect_YOLOv10.ipynb and run all
    ```

4. Open the `Helmet_detect_YOLOv10.ipynb` notebook and run the cells.

## Notebook Overview

The notebook is organized into the following sections:

1. **Introduction**: Provides an overview of the helmet detection task and the YOLOv10 model.
2. **Setup**: Instructions for setting up the environment and downloading necessary files.
3. **Data Preparation**: Steps for preparing the dataset for training and validation.
4. **Model Training**: Code for training the YOLOv10 model on the prepared dataset.
5. **Inference**: Running the trained model on test images to detect helmets.
6. **Evaluation**: Evaluating the model's performance and visualizing the results.

## Results

The notebook includes code to visualize the results of helmet detection. Example images with detected helmets will be displayed, showing the model's performance.
